Final Project:HospiHome
 App  : HospiHomes
 ->templates folder contains all the html pages used.
 ->static folder contains javascript files and images.
HospiHomes folder contains views.py,urls.py,admin.py...
HospiHome folder contains init.py,settings,urls...

JUSTIFICATION:
  My project is different from any other projects i did before in this course.
  ->It, a real time application, which is very useful in these situations.
  ->It contains two logins for users and admins.
  ->Hospital admins should update the vacancies and availabity of doctors every hour.
  ->Users can see in hospital page, the vacancies and doctor avialability and can plan accordingly to visit the hospital.
  ->User can also sumbit an appointment for the hospital and should wait for the approval.
  ->I think my website is complicated as it works on two phase mode(users and admins).
  ->I have created models and used javascript for page editing and for login buttons.
I hope ,i have fulfilled all the requirements.
 
In these pandemic situations, it is not safe to go to hospital,so it's better to first check the vacancies and availability and then go.
So you may develop this idea and make use of this please.
